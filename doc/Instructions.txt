Requirements:
-This uses stand alone version of HeidelTime published by the HeidelTime team at the Heidelberg University. It is a jar file along with a config.prop file, and a Licence file which is republished in this code.

-However to use HeidelTime, Helmut Schmid's tree tagger is used, and has to be downloaded. Only the english version is needed and can be downloaded at  http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/
The path to the tagger main directory has to be mentioned in config.props at treetaggerhome.
There is also a direct dependancy upon this tool by the corroborator tool.

-We also use Leonard Richardson's Beautiful Soup tool to parse the tagged strings. It is very useful and can be downloaded with pip.

-We query DBpedia using Sparql and for that there is a python library called SPARQLWrapper. Which will also need to be downloaded.


Instructions for use:
The file that contains main is corroboratorPOC.py. The input file is 'input'. The results are printed in command line and hence can be redirected to a file called results.txt while interpreting the python program.
The input file is specified as a parameter at in "if __name__=='main':" section.

Input:
A text file with free text, with some sentences having date information in them.

Output:
A tuple of (subject, annotated subject, Date Property, Date from mined from text, Date queried from DBpedia) for each sentence that includes keywords pertaining to birth and death.
